# OpenBAS NVD NIST CVE collector

The NVD NIST CVE collector is a standalone Python process that collects data from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database).

### CVE and CVSS base score V3.1

CVEs are assigned a criticality score (CVSS) making it possible to prioritize vulnerabilities and thus prioritize IS security projects.  
As of July 13th, 2022, the NVD will no longer generate new information for CVSS v2.  
Existing CVSS V2 information will remain in the database, but the NVD will no longer actively populate CVSS V2 for new CVEs.  
CVSS V3.1 was released in June 2019, thus most CVE published before 2019 do not include the `cvssMetricV31` object. The exception are CVE published before 2019 that were later reanalyzed or modified.  
These CVE may have been updated to include CVSS V3.1 information. If the CVE was updated in this way, the API response would include this optional information.

This collector **will import all CVE with CVSS V3.1 base score**.

## Requirements

- OpenBAS Platform version 1.19 or higher  
- (Optional but recommended) An **API Key for accessing NVD** – this increases your request rate limit.

👉 You can request a free API key here: [https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)

> **NIST firewall rules** are in place to prevent denial of service attacks.  
> Without an API key, your application is limited to **5 requests per 30 seconds** (rolling window).  
> With an API key, this limit increases to **50 requests per 30 seconds**.  
> However, it is still recommended to sleep for a few seconds between requests to avoid being throttled or denied.

## Installation

Get a local copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenBAS-Platform/collectors

(Note: you should also clone the [pyobas](https://github.com/OpenBAS-Platform/client-python) repository [according to these instructions](../README.md#simultaneous-development-on-pyobas-and-a-collector)):

```bash
# development environment
poetry install --extras dev

ℹ️ **Note:**
If you do not provide an API key, the collector will still work, but may be heavily rate-limited.
To improve reliability and speed of data collection, using an API key is **strongly recommended**.
